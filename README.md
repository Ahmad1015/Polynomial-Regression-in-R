# Polynomial Regression Project (R)

This project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression using R, focusing on the analysis of a dataset named 'Position_Salaries.csv'. Polynomial Regression is a regression analysis technique that models the relationship between the independent variable (in this case, "Level") and the dependent variable (in this case, "Salary") as an nth-degree polynomial.

## Prerequisites

Before running the R code in this project, ensure you have the following set up:

- R (version X.X.X or higher)
- Required R packages (ggplot2, caTools)

You can install the necessary packages using the following R commands:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("caTools")
```
## Project Overview
In this project, we perform the following tasks:
- Import the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset.
- Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.
- Fit Polynomial Regression to the dataset with different polynomial degrees.
- Visualize the Polynomial Regression results.
- Predict a new result using the trained Polynomial Regression model.
## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:
polynomial_regression.R: R script containing the code for Polynomial Regression analysis.
Position_Salaries.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
##  Getting Started
1) Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad1015/Polynomial-Regression-in-R.git
```
2) Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Polynomial-Regression-in-R
Open and run the polynomial_regression.R script in your preferred R environment.
## Usage
You can use this project as a reference for implementing Polynomial Regression in R for your own datasets. Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs.

## Results
The project includes visualizations of the Polynomial Regression results, allowing you to observe how well the model fits the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset.
